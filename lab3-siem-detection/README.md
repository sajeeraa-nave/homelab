# Lab 3: SIEM and Log Detection

Goal: Understand centralized logging, monitoring, and detection.

This lab includes:
- SIEM setup (Wazuh or Splunk)
- Log ingestion
- Failed login analysis
- Suspicious activity detection
- Basic attack detection workflow

Configuration steps, observations, troubleshooting, and screenshots will be documented here.

## Brute Force Detection
Explaination of detected repeated failed logins, what logs used, and patterns

## Alert Rule
Showing the rule or logic created in Wazuh/Splunk and what triggered it.

## Log Correlation
Explaination of connected multiple logs (example: failed login + unusual IP).
